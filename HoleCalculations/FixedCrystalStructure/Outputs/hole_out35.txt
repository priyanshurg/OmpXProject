 WARNING have not found a CVECT record - will try to guess
 WARNING have not found a CPOINT record - will try to guess
 Input pdb filename read as:    '1qj8.pdb'
 Input vdW radius file read as: '/oden/pgupta/hole2/rad/simple.rad'
 point in channel: ************************
 channel vector:   ************************
 sampling distance between planes:    0.250

 graphics conditions:
 binary plot output file name: NONE
 Dot density:    10
 Draw dots?           T
 Draw close contacts? F
 Draw centre line?    T
 Produce spikes rather than dots? F
 Seed for random number generator:         0 (0 means value set by program)
 Radius above which a result is regarded as an 'end':   5.000
 Pdb format file for sphere centres: hole_out.sph

 Monte Carlo conditions:
  no of steps:  1000
  maximum displacement   0.100 angs
  'kT' initial   0.100 angs
 The spherebox and capsule options are turned off.
 (No molqpt card so will not write qpt file of the molecule)
 No IGNORE card read so will read all residue types
 no SHORTO card read so will produce full textual output
 As no PEGRAT card was found will not produce PEG polymer exclusion graph
 (No 2DMAPS card specified so will not produce 2D property maps)
 Have not found a CUT card.  Normal calculation using
   Cutoff lists with a cutsize=       1.000
   (if you wish to turn off option use a CUT -1 card)

 Have read     8 bond radius records and
               9 vdW radius records.
 From file: /oden/pgupta/hole2/rad/simple.rad

 Have read  1203 atom records.
 From file: 1qj8.pdb
 Will not produce graphical output
 Warning have tried to open file: 'hole_out.sph' as NEW but
         this file already exists - old version kept as 'hole_out.sph.old'

 Have opened file for pdb format output of sphere centres:  hole_out.sph

 This is an end! (radius above   5.0 angs)
 
 N.b. Graph information routine (HOGRAP) differs 
        markedly from previous versions!
       Information now is written from -ve end
       to +ve in one pass
 
 Explanation of the meaning of each column: 
 First column "cenxyz.cvec" is the coordinate in the
   direction of the channel vector i.e. if the channel
   vector is in z (0 0 1) then it is the z coordinate.
 The second column "radius" is the hole pore radius 
   (as defined in the Biophys J 1993) article).
 The third column "cen_line_D" is the distance 
   measured along the pore centre line - with the 
   first point found set to zero. This was the first
   thing that I used to measure the distance along a pore
   but "cenxyz.cvec" is a much better general measure. 
   However, by comparing changes in this distance to changes in '   "cenxyz.cvec" one can get a measure of how straight a 
   channel is.
 The fourth column "sum{s/(area)}" is useful in conductance
   prediction -
   basically it is the sum of the thickness of each slab
   divided by its area. HOLE uses this measure to estimate
   the macroscopic conductance of a channel.
 If any of this worries you one can see the "raw" results
   of a standard hole run by producing a sphpdb file and 
    directly looking at the results.

 Minimum radius found:      0.158 angstroms.



 For spherical probe approach, The geometric factor
         F= sum(ds/area) along channel is   31.748 angstroms**-1
 This yields a macroscopic predicted molar conductance of:
   (1/rho)*(100/F)= (3.1/rho) pS,
   where rho is the conductivity of 1M permeant ion in ohm m.
 N.B. this is a macroscopic conductance - an overestimate 
 Empirically corrected conductances currently only available
 With the CAPSULE option (although its not that stable!)
 For 1M KCl rho= 1/12 (ohm m), So Gmacro= 38 pS/M.
  (TAG      1   Rmin=     0.15763   Gmacro=    37.79732 Conn_Gmacro=    -1.00000 ).
